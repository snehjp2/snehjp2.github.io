I’m giving this writing thing a shot.  Biased as I am towards telling stories with greek letters, integrals, and [bloated notation](/images/meme.png), I’m inclined to try new things. This post may or may not be word splatter.  I don't really care.  My training is in *physics*, after all.

My books have been haunting me.  My apartment is so unforgiving in that the only place I can escape their glare is the kitchen.  Even then I still haven't been much inclined to cook.

Nonetheless, I need them. Now that I’m a full time PhD student, I am taking the physics core all over again.  Any run-of-the-mill physicist will need his/her Classical Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism, and Quantum Mechanics texts.  If you’re like me, then General Relativity, Quantum Information, and some other science books that I’ve [failed to read](https://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567) are on the shelf.  I’m eventually looking forward to Quantum Field Theory texts joining their ranks, probably telling stories of a very frustrated Sneh struggling to understand [Wick’s Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick%27s_theorem).  In reopening some of these texts to jog my memory on the topics I’m covering in my classes, I’m also reopening memories of when these books were in my daily arsenal.  These are memories of [home](https://goo.gl/maps/PGtSgCTFF5CxJv4v6) and all the other people I read those books with.

These books are telling me stories.  I opened my copy of Griffiths' *Introduction to Electrodynamics* to brush up on [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics), a story about how particles at rest induce [weird electric fields](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/charges-and-fields/latest/charges-and-fields_en.html) around them, and how the geometry of these fields influences other charged particles.  This is mostly a lie by the way (or rather, incomplete), but by virtue of physics being a story that's still being told, today's truth could be tomorrow’s lie. This has actually happened pretty often (see: [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler)). It certainly doesn’t mean the story isn’t worth telling.

Yet, the other stories I see are in the wear and tear.  The binding of some of these books is tearing.  These are the stories of me hastily throwing the book in my college bag so I can catch the [12E Teal](https://mtd.org/media/3517/12-teal-weekday.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&rnd=132721317450000000) to class, only to fall asleep in any class that was before 11 am.  Or stories of me spilling my second cold brew of the day on a page about [Fourier transforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY).  Maybe that’s why I’m still so uncomfortable working in Fourier-space.  

They’re stories of getting home at 1 am, virtually brain dead, after working on a single homework problem for hours, only to wave my hands (physics-talk for 'bullshit') and give up.  These were usually group decisions though, before you accuse me of being a poor physicist.  I wouldn’t be in Boston right now rethinking my life decisions (jk...unless?) if it wasn’t for the people I shared this narrative with. I think about their stories too.

My current narrative will be embedded in the four new textbooks I purchased this semester.  Right now they are in near-pristine condition and I have no animosity towards them.  Surface level, they tell the stories of [Euler & Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler–Lagrange_equation), [Maxwell](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=maxwells+equation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), and [Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger_equation) (to name just a few). But they will also know of my fight-or-flight reaction when I entered my Fenway apartment for the first time, the excitement of meeting so many new people, the independence of being alone in a new city, and a plethora of other things I’ve experienced in a short time of just a couple of weeks.

Whenever I’m on the phone with my mom, she jokingly asks me: “Working hard or hardly working?”  I guess this post is a testament to the latter.  I assure you though, I will buckle down with my books and get things done.  

Thanks for checking in.
