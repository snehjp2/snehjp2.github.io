I took up this 'writing' thing last September because I found it to be incredibly cathartic. What initially started as a journal I eventually sculpted into these posts to start sharing with a few friends, and then to my private twitter account (my shitposting one, iykyk). A few friends encouraged me to keep writing and I've tried my best to be semi-consistent with it. What its become is me writing these posts when I find myself able to catch my breath.

Last September I was in a pretty vulnerable state. It was my first time starting completely anew. When I left for college I had my best friend still with me, and my sister was also attending UIUC at the time. So in a sense, I never really left home. Not to say I didn't grow at all in college, but my safety net of family and friends, which I am incredibly grateful to have, never left me.

When I was finally stranded in Boston, the reality of the this decision that I first considered in high school, that I worked towards during my undergraduate degree, that was built up during that summer where I maximized the 'summer' part and perpetually procrastinated on the whole 'how-am-I-going-to-move' part, hit me all at once. It culminated with me, alone, in my barely furnished tiny studio apartment, in a city I did not know, embarking on a ~5 year adventure which I was (at the time) having second thoughts about. I missed my friends and I missed my family. I was also (self) diagnosed with a severe case of FOMO. But it didn't matter; I was here to *work*.

The first semester of my degree was difficult. I was becoming acclamated to life in Boston. I frequently hopped on the wrong line on the T (Boston's transit system), I was (allegedly) consistently cooking meals for one, searching for the so-called work/life balance and never found it, and trying to combat the mind-numbing silence of a weekend spent doing work instead of at happy hour. There were some pretty bad habits I broke in college but started again, and similarly good habits I had that started to fade.

I was taking three physics courses and not necessarily doing the best in all of them. Now that I've completed my first year, an interesting statistic I'd like to share: the difference between my *highest* and *lowest* grade on an exam during my first year was **91%**. Think about that again. Working my ass off was no longer a gaurantee to pass, and to fail meant I wouldn't get my PhD. The academic stress caused me to lose a lot of weight, and my mental health was suffering. But it didn't matter; I was here to *work*.

I was also teaching, and grading, and trying to come off as professional and composed to my undergraduate students when in reality, I felt more lost than they likely did in their physics class. I viewed teaching as a burden, and I developed animosity towards the idea of having to do this for financial support the rest of my degree.

I passed my first semester, and I used my winter break to regroup and take a physics-detox. I promised myself I would be better in the Spring, and I didn't do everything I wanted to do, but I did a lot. Most notably, I shifted my mindset of how I would tackle this degree. Yes, I was in Boston to *work*, but I was also there to *live*.

I got all A's in my classes in the spring. I didn't bomb any exams, and I went to most of my lectures. I still spent a bit too much time on my homework than I would have liked to have spent, but that's a (home)work in progress. I transitioned my view on teaching as a way to better myself as an academic, and as a person. Teaching has made me more patient and more sympathetic towards the substantial percentage of college students who will encounter physics and will absolutely despise it. I'm happy to say that based on my Spring reviews, I made it more bearable for some of my students. I also began doing research, which I sorely missed, and I learned a lot. I'd rather not bore the reader with details on machine learning theory. But if you care, I'm more than happy to share what I've been doing.

I couldn't resist, heres a few of my favorite papers from the Spring:

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11104 (neural networks evolve in the same way as the Universe.)
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02306 (neural networks can rediscover Newton's law of gravity *on its own*.)
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06175 (new state-of-the-art of artificial general intelligence.)

I began going to the gym again, and remembered just how good taking an hour out of your day for your body can feel. I meal-prepped more, but I still spent far too much money on Uber eats. I went out more on the weekends, and found some friends outside of my amazing group of physicist friends (which I am incredibly grateful to have). I took a weekend trip to visit some family on the east coast. I also saw some of my favorite bands in concert (HOMESHAKE, Spirit of the Beehive, and alt-J). I ate at new restaurants in parts of Boston I hadn't previously been to. I saw one of my idols speak at MIT. I went rock climbing a few times with my friends. I had friends from high school and college visit. I went on a bike ride to a brewery to celebrate the end of the semester. I *lived*.

I am still conflicted on how I feel about Boston. I do sorely miss my friends and family when I am there, and the FOMO has not completely gone away. The city is great, but expensive, and school is all I ever wanted it to be, but somehow everything I dreaded. There will never be enough time to do everything I need and want to do, and I'm a workaholic. This was a match made in Hell. So I write this to remind myself that I am here to *work*, but I am also here to *live*.
