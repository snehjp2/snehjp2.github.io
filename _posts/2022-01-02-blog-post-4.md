Math is one of the non-negotiables of being a physicist.  I do math a lot, every day. It is as natural for a physicist to do math as writing is for an author. But I've recently took some time to reflect on the math I know and do so frequently, and when math transitioned for me as just another subject in school to something profoundly important and necessary.  One day I was doing multiplication tables, the next I was considering infinite dimesional vector spaces in Quantum Mechanics. How the fuck does that happen?

It has certainly had a toll on my ego. The more math I learn the less I know. It’s like playing a game with an [infinite skill cap](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/). Math is also unforgivable.  A missing factor of two or displaced minus sign could ruin your entire day. Yet somehow, I still keep doing it.  

I never had a vendetta towards math growing up. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but then again math didn't start being even vaguely interesting until calculus, which was introduced to me in the 12th grade. My position on math as a whole solidified as I was introduced to more [complex mathematics for physics](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=lagrangian+hamilton&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8); then it became clear to me that mathematics is not only a method, but a language and a form of expression. For some reason or another, Nature has chosen math as the avenue to reveal Her secrets.

And it is not intuitive for this to be true! Life is biological, its processes' are chemical, and the atoms are governed by physics. Yet, there is math beneath it all and this sentiment has been discovered and rediscovered by mathematicians and physicists alike for thousands of years. [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) (followers of Pythagoras) held the doctrine, "Numbers rule the world," following the footsteps of their teacher who built on many important ideas from [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry). Much Later, Galileo famously wrote that "The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics."  The math that so many of us take for granted actually provided humanity the first glimpses into Nature, and were quintissential in the development of the sciences, economics, and countless other disciplines. The development of the modern world is a testemant to the role math has had and will continue to have, whether we like it or not.

But now we have computers, and iPhones, and AI and Amazon x Whole Foods. Is there any point in learning all this [*old* math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebombo_bone) and is it worth looking for more? Is research in pure mathematics worth funding?

Math, in fact, continues to be the cool new kid on the block. Without getting into excruciating detail, any and all blockchains are products of fundamental mathematics. [Zero-knowledge proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c), developed in the 1980's, are an avenue for powerful encryption schemes being used in some cryptocurrencies, and the global crypto market size in 2020 was valued at $1,500,000,000.00. Artificial intelligence (AI) also benefits from math. [Neural networks](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2,2,2,2,2&seed=0.75450&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) were first developed around the late 1950s, inspired by the structure of biological neurons. Their inner machinery is surface-level just a bunch of matrix multiplication, one of the first things learned in an introductory [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc) course. Their success as a whole, however, still remains largely elusive (think: how do we go from billions of water droplets to waves?). In the past few years, an exciting equivalence has emerged between [kernel machines](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/), a much older idea in mathematics, and neural networks. Needless to say, there is money in AI. And by extension, there is merit and money in learning and pursuing mathematics, old and new.

I think its a significant failure of the American education system to emphasize meaningless arithmetic for most students' math education, and I believe the way the math curriculum is currently structured is the fundamental reason why so many adults despise math and believe they are bad at it. Knowing what 8x7 is at best convenient, and understanding fractions and percentages is nice when figuring out how much to tip your bartender. But doing it fast is irrelevant because our phones can do all that -- [and much more](https://www.wolframalpha.com) -- much faster than us. It's dissapointing to think that so many peoples' perceptions of mathematics is tainted by [procedural arithmetic](https://www.math-drills.com/multiplication/multiplication_facts_to_144_no01_001qp.1613654234.pdf) like this.

Even in high school when transitioning towards more complex mathematics, math was still taught under the guise of being something methodic that required useless, useless memorization. The emphasis was put on learning a well-defined procedure rather than developing mathematical intuition, and there was hardly any mention of the bigger picture at hand. When learning trigonometry, are we told how the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity) is actually the language of waves, and how [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave) discovered in 1924 that all matter has an associated wavelength, so certainly there is some importance in this idea? Do we learn that the [number e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) is simultaneously the language of compound interest, population growth, and the [bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUTGFQpKaPU) between the real and complex numbers? Were we taught that the existence of [pi](https://www.piday.org/million/) provides immense insight into the geometry of our Universe? Or were we taught that pi is just 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749... None of this was deemed that important, but doing long division by hand was.

  <em>"Perhaps the most beautiful and famous equation in all of mathematics."</em>
</p>

There is [prose in mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhNUjg9X4g8); proving things requires rhetoric and so does [approximating things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) (I shamelessly do the latter much, much more than the former). I do not know how to do long division by hand and I sometimes plug 8x7 into my calculator. And I certainly dont know how to integrate by hand, anymore. Yet I call myself a "math person."  This goes to show that math is something inherently much deeper than the distorted perceptions of method and arithmetic many may have. Mathematics = [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols) = [art](https://math.hws.edu/eck/js/mandelbrot/MB.html = [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem) = ∞-ly much more.
<!-- 
I'd like to offer a quick tour on some of my favorite topics in mathematics that I've encountered so far in my studies, with the hope of instilling some beauty that exists in mathematics.   Needless to say, I still know very little in the grand scheme of things, and physicists infamously pick and choose parts of math that are useful to them, and shamelessly disregard the rigorous foundation that is necessary to apply many of these ideas. I'm guilty of learning math in this way and am trying my best going forward to develop a deeper apprecaition of the concepts I take for granted.


The Fourier Series

Noether's Theorem

The Unit Circle


*Calculus*

If you didn't study STEM in college, theres a chance that your education in math stopped at or just before calculus.  Calculus is the study of continuous change. It's an indespensable tool for physicists. The primary tools of calculus are derivatives and integrals; they are related by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In physics, we always want to know how things are changing in time (speed is the instantaneous change in position over time, acceleration is the instantaneous change in speed over time) and space. These 'things' are functions, and you can consider them to be basically little machines that take in one or a variety of inputs and spit out one output.

If you can find out how things are changing you can also find when they are not; these are known as minima or maxima of functions. In a physics context, for example, we may be interested in at what radius I should orbit a star to minimize my potential energy, which corresponds to a circular orbit.

To shit on the American education system some more, physics is for some reason introduced to high-schoolers as an algebra-based science. That is the farthest thing from true, and likely the most contributing factor to most adult's detestation for physics. Doing physics this way makes an already complex subject even more complicated.

*Differential Equations*

Everything is a differential equation.  And the way you solve a differential equation is by already knowing the answer.  Ok, done.

Well, not exactly.  A differential equation is an equation that relates functions and how they change with respect to other things.  They are rampant in physics; a famous example is Newton's Second Law, F=ma.  'a' here is acceleration, which is the second derivative of position with respect to time, and here it is in an equation.  Differential equation.

There are so few differential equations with analytical solutions (ones that I can write down manageably on a piece of paper), that by the time you solve enough of them, you'll just know the answer when you see a new one.  The tools of calculus are neceessary to solve differential equations.  It is very nice that most problems in physics come to down to one of four different types of differnetial equations, and they each have their own set of tried-and-true tips and tricks to solve them. We see far because we stand on the shoulders of giants.  

Nonetheless, they are hard, and a primary source of a physicists' never-ending agony.

*Partial Differential Equations*

Just adding one word at the beginning creates an undiscovered ring of hell to get lost in.  These equations are an extension of 'ordinary' differential equations, except now the function is dependent on multiple things (called a multivaariate function), and you'd like to know how it depends on only one of the many possible inputs. Unfortunately, the window of solvability shrinks here once again. These are almost never solvable, and there is one (1) reliable method to obtain analytic solutions to partial differential equations that physicists employ frequently. It's called the method of separation of variables, and it is extraordinarily clever. It is worth noting that this method allowed mankind to solve the Hydrogen atom. That is incredible.

A notable failure, however, of our ability to solve PDEs is that of the problem of fluid flow, the Navier-Stokes equation.  The reason you may experience turbulence on your next flight is because we haven't been able to solve these equations.  *Laminar flow* is modelable using these equations; turbulent flow is not.  If you do happen to solve the equation, please follow this link to redeem your $1,000,000 Millenium prize.

*Complex Analysis*

Truly beautiful stuff here. I wish I could learn it all. Complex analysis is the study of the properties of complex numbers, first introduced to most students as *imaginary* numbers. The naming is unfortunate as they are all but imaginary, and are very useful.

Here arises very beautiful definitions of completeness, the idea that functions can be composed of (in)finite sums of other (usually simpler) functions. I like to think of this as similar to pointillism in art. If you ever taken any math class beyond calculus, you've likely heard of the Fourier Series.  The fourier series is a completeness relation that uses trigonometric functions.  Complex analysis takes that to a whole other level.

There are some really convenient ways to do integrals as well, and thats the bulk of the exciting stuff in complex analysis, but I wont go into much detail because its really hard to explain.  

The most popular theorem in complex analysis is known as *Euler's Identity*. It's an inch-long equation that relates three of perhaps the most famous numbers in mathematics: \pi, e, and the complex number, i.  It might be the most famous equation in all of mathematics.

*Linear Algebra*

Matrices, schmatrices.  This is a staple in many methods of mathematics.  Linear algebra is the study of linear equations and how they can be represented as vector spaces. The tools that are used in linear algebra are used all over the place in physics.

In physics, if you have a system of many moving parts, many times only one equation doesnt cut it.  You might need one or two or three or N equations, and if you throw them all together in a box-formation and call it a matrix, you can do stuff to all of them all at once instead of wasting your time doing stuff piecewise.  This is of course only one application of linear algebra.  There's a lot of insight into higher-dimensional vector spaces (*yawn*) that requires the langauge of linear algebra.

*Differential Geometry*

Einstein brought this unsuspecting supesrstar into the limelight.  Diffferential geometry, like the name suggests, combines calculus and geometry to a certain extent and allows the study of smooth and curved surfaces.  Quite famously in physics, gravity is described through tihs framework.  Space and time are actually a 4-D surface of sorts (in 3D, akin to a bedsheet) and the phenomenen of gravity that we observe is the distortions in this higher dimensional fabric that cause the planets to move and apples to fall.

*Bayesian Statistics*





I hope I've given you a sufficient glimpse into the many worlds I interact with on the daily, and hopefully you've made it this far and have some more appreciation for math
And its a relevant question as to why nature chooses to reveal its intentions through mathematics.  Why not English? Or why not Wingdings? -->
