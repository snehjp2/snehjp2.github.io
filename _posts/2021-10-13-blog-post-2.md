“Do you like it [the program] so far? Like taking all these classes?”

“I hate that I like it.”

I tried taking a physics hiatus towards the end of my undergrad.  I was a little burnt out from the grind of physics courses, and intended to give myself a brain break by only taking *fun* classes.  Fun for me in this case included two [statistics courses](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) and a [philosophy of physics](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/physics-needs-philosophy-philosophy-needs-physics/) course. I had the passion to become well rounded and dabble in the humanities while I was in college; I unfortunately rarely acted on this.  Instead, I ended up missing physics so much that I took [General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations), the brainchild of Einstein, as an impulse decision during my last semester of college.  By that point I had already applied to graduate school and in a sense, nothing mattered (If you are @ Northeastern and see this, no you didn't).  I could’ve been a part time student if I wanted, but no - I instead opted for a dive in the world of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), a framework that describes smooth and curved surfaces, and some of the most asbtract math I've ever encountered. I can't and won't let myself rest. And I hate that I like it.

The last weeks have been a blur.  Mondays become Fridays become Tuesdays which then become the middle of October.  If not teaching or in class, I am likely doing physics in some way, shape, or form.  It has completely engulfed my life at this point.  And this is completely reasonable, as I did indeed willingly sign up to pursue my PhD.  

Getting into the nitty gritty of what Nature likes to do has been my comfort zone for seven years now.  And I’d be completely fine doing (physically-motivated) math and coding for the rest of my life (they’re pretty much the same thing at this point).  Part of me still sometimes thinks though, wouldn’t it have been easier if I didn’t like it? It’s fun to entertain this thought.

What if I pursued a “normal” degree?  What if it was a well marketable degree and I was able to pursue my passion right out of undergrad, and perhaps I’d be in Chicago - the city where my heart is. I could be making some serious ca$h right now in industry, and maybe I could afford to eat at the Michelin-starred [restaurant](https://venteuxchicago.com) that one of my best friends just started working at.  Maybe I’d be living in the city with my college friends (or my high school ones), seeing my parents and my sisters on the weekends, and enjoying the stability of an entry level job right out of college. (Many aspects of this scenario aren’t necessarily tied to my life path.  There are maybe some shortcomings on my end and a generous sprinkle of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)).)

Nature quite famously takes the lazy route in everything She does, which is formalized in the [Principle of Least Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary-action_principle).  It’s a beautiful way to think about physics.  I’ve seemed to always defy this very law in my decisions, however, as I currently anticipate matriculating as a 21st-grader. Despite all the allure, I still can’t imagine things going any other way.

What if I wasn’t able to entertain my friends' questions about [black holes](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/astronomers-image-magnetic-fields-edge-m87s-black-hole), [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter), and all the other beautiful moving parts of the Universe? What if I didn’t know about the mathematical beauty that is [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space)? What if I didn’t think of classical mechanics every time I saw a block (which I’m actually treating as a point particle) on a frictionless surface inclined at an angle *θ*? Ok, I still haven't seen that last scenario in daily life yet; still waiting.

In fact I would not be my current self, an approximately cylindrical cluster of atoms cruising through life and violating the Principle of Least Action on the daily.  Newton once said, [“Nature is very consonant and conformable with herself.”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cplx.6130010404) Nature simply does what She likes to do, and by virtue of it being the only thing to do, it is always the right thing to do.
