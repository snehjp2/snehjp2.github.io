> * "A method is more important than a discovery, since the right method will lead to new and even more important discoveries." - Lev Landau

Hello! I'm a third year Ph.D. candidate in physics @ [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) and the NSF AI Insititute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions ([IAIFI](https://iaifi.org)) advised by [Jim Halverson](http://www.jhhalverson.com) and [Jonathan Blazek](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jonathan-blazek/). I'm also a member of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration ([DESC](https://lsstdesc.org)). I'm a physicist and a cosmologist. I'm generally interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics, particularly applications which utilize geometric deep learning and probabalistic inference.

My past research focused on effective deep learning algorithms to weigh [supermassive black holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsp3_a-PMTw). Please see my [publications](https://snehjp2.github.io/publications/) for my most recent work.

I earned my BSc in Engineering Physics with minors in Math & Astronomy from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) (UIUC). I was a NSF fellow at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) and [Galaxy and Black Hole Astrophysics Group](https://publish.illinois.edu/liu-group/) working under Dr. Xin Liu.

In my freetime, I enjoy weightlifting, biking, and adding records to online shopping carts which never get checked out.
