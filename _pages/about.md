> * "A method is more important than a discovery, since the right method will lead to new and even more important discoveries." - Lev Landau

Hello! I'm a first year PhD student in physics @ [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu).  I'm generally interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics, and experimental applications in astrophysics and cosmology.

I earned my BSc in Engineering Physics with minors in Math & Astronomy from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) (UIUC). I spent the majority of my time as a research fellow at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) and [Galaxy and Black Hole Astrophysics Group](https://publish.illinois.edu/liu-group/) working under Dr. Xin Liu. I'm also very fortunate to have worked with Dr. Yonatahn Kahn, Dr. Matias Carrasco-Kind, and Dr. Douglas Beck at UIUC.

My work has been [published](https://snehjp2.github.io/publications/) at [NeurIPS](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/). My current [research](https://snehjp2.github.io/research/) focuses on effective deep learning algorithms to weigh [supermassive black holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsp3_a-PMTw). I recently attended the [Princeton Deep Learning Theory Summer School](https://deep-learning-summer-school.princeton.edu) which inspired another current focus of mine, analyzing neural networks with the machinery of physics.
