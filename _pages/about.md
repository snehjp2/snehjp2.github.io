Hello! I'm a first year PhD student in physics @ Northeastern University.  I'm generally interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics, specifically applications in astrophysics, high energy physics, and cosmology.  

As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), I spent majority of my time as a research fellow at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) and [Galaxy and Black Hole Astrophysics Group](https://publish.illinois.edu/liu-group/) working under Dr. Xin Liu.  My work involved developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh supermassive black holes employing time series data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

I'm currently working for Dr. Yonatahn Kahn at UIUC in the high-energy theory group.  My research involves studying deep neural networks through the lens of statistical field theory and verifying analytical results with numerical simulations. I'm also very fortunate to have worked with Dr. Matias Carrasco-Kind and Dr. Douglas Beck at UIUC.
