My current research revolves around AI x Physics. I've worked on two major projects:

**Weighing Black Holes with Deep/Machine Learning**

- As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), my work involved developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh supermassive black holes employing time series data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I constructed the data analysis pipeline, the MLP used in the deep learning pipeline, and automated several necessary statistics and calculations.

**Neural Networks Through the Lens of Statistical Field Theory**

- Under the guidance of Dr. Yonatahn Kahn at UIUC in the high-energy theory group, I studied deep neural networks through the lens of statistical field theory and verified analytical results with numerical simulations.
