My current research revolves around **AI x Physics**. I've worked on two major projects:

## Weighing Black Holes with Deep/Machine Learning

- As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), my work involved developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh supermassive black holes employing time series data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

## Neural Networks Through the Lens of Statistical Field Theory

- Under the guidance of Dr. Yonatahn Kahn at UIUC in the high-energy theory group, I studied deep neural networks through the lens of statistical field theory and verified analytical results with numerical simulations. I worked to understand the nearly-Gaussian corrections on the distribution of weights of particular neurons in a deep linear network after passing data.
